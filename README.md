## Description
The BMI Calculator App is a two-screen application that calculates and displays the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user-provided weight and height inputs. This app serves as a practical demonstration of various Flutter concepts I've learnt so far from Angela Yu's Flutter course.

## Features
- Calculates and displays BMI index
- Demonstrates key Flutter concepts:
  - Stateless and Stateful Widgets
  - Rows and Columns for layout
  - Creating custom widgets

## Future Release Plans
In future releases, the following enhancements are planned:

1. **Accept Different Units:** Introduce a dropdown list that allows users to select different units for weight (e.g., kg, lbs) and height (e.g., cm, inches).
2. **Display Results in Chosen Units:** Display all BMI results and related information in the chosen units, providing users with a more personalized experience.
3. **Data Persistence:** Implement the ability to save BMI results to a text file on the user's device. This feature could be triggered by a button on the results page.

## Installation and Usage
To use the BMI Calculator App:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred Flutter development environment.
3. Run the app on an emulator or physical device.
