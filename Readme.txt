This app is a two screen app that calculates and displays BMI index(body mass index).
Its a demonstration of some of the flutter concepts that i've learnt so far following Angela woo's course on flutter.


    It covers basic things such as:
        i. stateless and stateful widgets
        ii. Rows and columns
        ii. creating custom widgets and many more


This to do in future release:
1. Accept different units for weight and height, using drop down list.
2. Display all results in the chosen units
3. Create a text file that store results info and save to user's devices if required
   using a button on results page
